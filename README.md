## Setup

The project python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Before running code in this repo:

1. Make a new virtualenv:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path to your credentials>` - a service account json. You should have at``
least BQ reader permissions, if you are a CSET user. If you are not a CSET user, then you will not be able to
run some of this code as-is, since it depends on our internal BigQuery datasets. Please contact us if you are
interested in collaborating or spot any issues.

3. [Install and run the web interface](/web/README.md#web-interface)
