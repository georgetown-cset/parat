For example, some companies may have lots of AI-related patents, others might sell a lot of AI products, and others might hire a lot of talented AI engineers.

PARAT includes parent-subsidiary mappings for many companies. When a subsidiary is mapped to a parent, the subsidiary's publications, patents, etc. are attributed to the parent company. (The \"Included Subsidiaries\" metadata field for each parent company lists any subsidiaries treated this way.) In other cases, our data sources already consolidate a subsidiary's data with its parent, or the queries we run on those data sources collect parent and subsidiary data together by design.
