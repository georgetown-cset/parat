## Why isn't *[insert company here]* on the list?

We update CARAT's list of companies according to CSET's analytic needs and feedback from users. Adding new companies takes significant work, so we make these updates periodically. If you think a specific company should be added to CARAT, please [let us know](https://forms.gle/7RxrtAJHya2FmjXB6).

## Are all of these companies AI companies?

Not necessarily. Being included in CARAT, in and of itself, doesn't mean that a company is an "AI company" or is especially active in AI. We include companies in CARAT for a variety of reasons related to CSET's analytic needs and feedback from users.

## Why isn't *[insert company here]* ranked higher?

CARAT isn't meant to be a "top AI companies" list. Which companies are at the "top" depends on the metrics and companies that are considered. For example, some companies may have lots of AI-related patents, others might sell a lot of AI products, and others might hire a lot of talented AI engineers. CARAT doesn't cover all of the metrics and companies that would be needed to draw general conclusions about which companies are ahead of others in AI, and it doesn't make judgments about whether some metrics are more important than others.

The numerical rankings that appear in CARAT, displayed alongside our patent and publication metrics, are generated automatically from our patent and publication datasets. They reflect how each company compares to the other companies in CARAT according to these specific metrics - not whether that company is more innovative or capable in AI overall.

## Can I get the raw data that goes into CARAT?

You can use CARAT's export feature to generate the following data and metadata in tabular format:

**[____insert summary of export]**

We also share the code used to generate CARAT in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/georgetown-cset/ai-companies-visualization). Licensing restrictions prevent us from sharing the underlying publication and patent [data sources](_____), but if you have access to these datasets (some of which are free), you can use CARAT metadata to efficiently query them. For example, you can use the GRID identifiers compiled in CARAT to quickly find a company's publications in databases like [Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai/) or [Microsoft Academic Graph](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-academic-graph/).

## Could you please add *[insert feature here]*?

Maybe! CARAT is a work in progress, and we hope to add several new features in the coming months. You can suggest new features [here](https://forms.gle/7RxrtAJHya2FmjXB6).

## I see a problem!

Please [let us know](https://forms.gle/7RxrtAJHya2FmjXB6). We appreciate your help improving the tool!
